## Additional features that I would love to add:

Unfortunately, I didnt have a lot of time to add all features that I wanted but I had a lot of fun in the process! I know that this small app needs a lot of refactoring and here are only the few things I would add/change:

- Add unit tests
- Use Redux or Context API to manage state
- Connect a database, add data persistence
- Add game history
- Optimize for phones and tablets, add media queries
- Allow a user to enter a name when starting a game
- Add more statistics
- Add a menu
- Use Material UI to style some of the components
- Add level of dofficulty - easy, medium, hard. Each level would have a different time limit. Hard - 1 minute, medium - 2 minutes, easy - 3 minutes to answer all the questions
- Add hints
- Stop users from skipping the questions without answering them
- Display a different message on the final page depending on the score
- Improve the UI, make it more user-friendly
