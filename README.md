# How to use this app

You can see this app in action here: https://react-trivia-app-tandem.herokuapp.com/. Have fun!

This app was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Additional features that I want to add:

Unfortunately, I didnt have a lot of time to add all features that I wanted but I had a lot of fun in the process! I know that this small app needs a lot of refactoring and here are only the few things I would add/change:

- Use Redux or Context API to manage state
- Connect a database, add data persistence
- Add game history
- Allow a user to enter a name when starting a game
- Add more statistics
- Add a menu
- right now, users are able to skip the questions. Ideally, I woudn't allow it and would check if the person answered before going to the next question.
- display a different message on the final page depending on the score
